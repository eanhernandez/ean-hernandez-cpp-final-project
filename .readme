Notes:

* The following subjects from the 2nd term C++ course are applied in this program:

lambdas - response.hpp/.cpp
functors - ReadAggregatorFunctor.hpp/.cpp
abstract factory (template based) - ResponseAbstractFactory.hpp/.cpp
threads - session.hpp/.cpp, client.hpp/.cpp
auto_ptr - session.hpp/.cpp, client.hpp/.cpp
tuples - response.hpp/.cpp
templated functions - argsparser.hpp/.cpp

* Main.cpp is the entry point.

* Comments added in this version provide clarity about intent.

* Reduced complexity in both session and client asio calls, now we have a low fail rate.

* Errors returned by client calls are simply handled and discarded, they no longer crash the program.

* Abstract Factory pattern is now implemented using the template based approach from lecture 16
